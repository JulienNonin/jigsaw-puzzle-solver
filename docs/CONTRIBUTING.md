# Git Commit Conventions
* Use the present tense
* Use the imperative mood
* Commits must be named as follows: `[Type] Description`

### Commit Types
Consider starting the commit message with the following "types" (should be placed in brackets):
* **[_Nothing_]**: 
* **Add or Feat**: Adding a modification or a new feature
* **Fix**: a bug fix or fixing test
* **Fix #[issue]**: fix an issue reported on GitHub
* **Test**: adding of new tests
* **Clean**: (re)move some files / folders
* **Refactor**: refactoring code
* **Merge**: merging commits / branches

### Example of commit messages : 
* **[Fix] : Fix broken tests due to refactoring**
* **[Add] : Adding the possibility to create a puzzle from an image**
* **[Clean] : Making the code for the random solver more readable**

### How to write long comments ?

Just enumerate what is new and what can potentially cause a conflict.
